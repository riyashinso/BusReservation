This is a simple Java console-based project called Bus Reservation System. In this system, a customer can book a seat on a bus by entering their name, the bus number they want to travel in, and the date, month, and year of travel. 
The program checks whether seats are available for the selected bus on that date. If the seats are already filled, it displays a message saying "Sorry, seats are filled" and also shows the bus number and its total capacity. 
If seats are available, the booking is confirmed. The system also provides an option to exit the program by pressing 2. 
This project demonstrates basic Java concepts such as classes, objects, user input handling, date processing, condition checks, and loop control, all applied to a real-world use case.
